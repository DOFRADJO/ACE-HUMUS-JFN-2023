COMPUTE ENGINE
--------------

GCE is an IaaS
It comes with a persistent disk, cloud Laod Balancing, auto scaling

1) Machine Family
  -------------

--> General Purpose

(E2, N2, N2D, N1) 
Best price-performance ratio
Web and application servers, Small-medium db, Dev environments


--> Memory Optimized

(M2, M1) 
Ultra high memory workloads
Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics

--> Compute Optimized
(C2)
Compute intensive workloads
Gaming applications


2) Machine Type
   
   e.g e2-standard-2:
            e2 - Machine Type Family
            standard - Type of workload
            2 - Number of CPUs


3)Image (0S)

$ echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html

EXPLANATION OF COMMAND
$(hostname) --> variable that will return hostname 
$(hostname -I) --> variable that will return the internal ip address of host
so the host name and internal ip address will appended to the endpoint index.html in /var/www/html/index.html

4)IP address
IP address is used to uniquely identify a resource
internal and external IP address of vm are ephermal by default
You can assign and release a static IP address


5)Bootstrapping 
is the process os installing tools, softwares or OS patch on VM instance launch
You csn do so using a Startup script
It increase boot time

6)Instance Tempplate 
Is a Blueprint to creating identical instances  
It is used to create VM instances ad MIGs
It can not be updated


7)Custom Image
Is a VM instance with your customised configurations
Can be created from an instance, a persistent disk, a snapshot, another
image, or a file in Cloud Storage
Can be shared across projects

8)Discounts
-->Sustained Use Discounts 
Automatic discounts for running VM instances for significant portion of the billing month
e.g If you use VM for more than 25% of a month, you get a 20% to 50% discount on every incremental minute.
Applicable for instances created by GKE and GCE
Does NOT apply to E2 and A2, App Engine flexible VMs and Dataflow

-->Committed use Discounts
For workloads with predictable resource needs. Commit for 1 year or 3 years
Up to 70% discount based on machine type and GPUs
Applicable for instances created by GKE and GCE
Does NOT apply to VMs created by App Engine flexible and Dataflow

-->Preemptible/Sport VM
Can be stopped by GCP any time (preempted) within 24 hours Instances get 30 second warning (to save anything they want to save)
Use Preempt VM's if: your apps are fault tolerant, You are very cost sensitive
Your workload is NOT immediate e.g Non immediate batch processing jobs

NOT always available, NO SLA and CANNOT be migrated to regular VMs, NO Automatic Restarts
Free Tier credits not applicable


9)GCE Billing
You are billed by the second (after a minimum of 1 minute)
You will be billed for any storage, static IP attached with it even VM is stopped!

10)Live Migration
keep your VM instances running when a host system needs to be updated
your running instance is migrated to another host in the same zone
SUPPORTED for instances with local SSDs
NOT SUPPORTED for GPUs and preemptible instances
Availability Policy has two options; Migrate (default) and Terminate 
Automatic restart  


11)Custom Machine Type
Create a machine type customized to your needs, Adjust vCPUs, memory and GPUs
Billed per vCPUs, memory provisioned to each instance

12)GPU
Add a GPU to your VM for math intensive and graphics-intensive workloads
Higher cost
Use images with GPU libraries (Deep Learning) installed OTHERWISE, GPU will not be used
NOT supported on shared-core or memory-optimized machine types
On host maintenance can only have the value "Terminate VM instance"
Recommended Availability policy for GPUs Automatic restart - on

NB
--

Automatic Basic Monitoring is enabled
CPU utilization, Network Bytes (in/out), Disk Throughput/IOPS
For Memory Utilization & Disk Space Utilization - Cloud Monitoring agent is needed

Choose Zone and Region based on: Cost, Regulations, Availability Needs, Latency and Specific Hardware needs

pre-requisites to be able to create a VM instance
-->Project -->Billing Account -->Compute Engines APIs should be enabled

Sole-tenant nodes; Physical nodes reserved just for your enterpriseprise.
